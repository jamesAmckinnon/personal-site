                    Many people don’t even think about space as they go about their day. They see the sun, they see the moon, and they see the stars. They feel the weight of gravity, they see the light, and they breath the molecules in the air. These are the things that keep us alive yet none of them are talked about in the average conversation. Maybe people are distracted. Maybe they just don’t care. Maybe as a result of all of the distractions and nonchalance we have forgotten where we are. A tiny spec of dust in an unimaginably large universe. I think it’s good to remind ourselves of this sometimes because It can provide perspective on what is important.

                    When I look at the sky during the day I see a ball of fire so massive that only it’s equally staggering distance away from us allows it’s true scale to be masked. At night, similar objects become visible all around us and the masquerade continues as the distances become even more incomprehensible. The next closest star to us is over 4 light years away which is significantly farther than the 150 million kilometers that we are away from our star. Our galaxy is among billions of others in the universe and most of these galaxies are rapidly moving away from each other as the universe expands. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The reason for the expansion is unknown but most scientists believe that the big bang theory is the most likely explanation.

                    The Big Bang
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    If everything is moving away from everything else in space as time goes on, everything would get closer together if time was reversed. The universe had to have started expanding at some point, and this is known as the big bang. The fact that the universe is expanding and the fact that there is a microwave background present all around us is the most easily explained evidence to support the theory.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Scientists can observe that the universe is expanding by studying light from very distant galaxies. The light received from almost all of the galaxies that are observed demonstrates what is known as redshifting which is what happens to light when the light source is moving away from the observer. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Redshifting occurs as a result of wavelengths of light being stretched as the source of the light moves further away. It is called redshifting because the lights frequency is shifting towards the lower end of the visible spectrum as the wavelengths get longer. As a source of light moves towards the observer the wavelength shortens and the frequency increases. This is known as blueshifting. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    On the electromagnetic spectrum the wavelength of red light becomes visible when the frequency drops below 430 trillion cycles per second (hertz) and the wavelength of blue light becomes visible when the frequency rises above 610 trillion hertz. 
                    <br></br>

                    Light can also shift past the visible range into any other section of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the gamma or radio wave ranges depending on if the electromagnetic waves are moving away from or towards the observer, how far they have to travel and how much energy they have. The frequency of light decreases as the distance between the observer and the light source grows while the photons are traveling through space.

                    This can be visualized by someone laying items on a conveyor belt for you to receive and simultaneously walking away from you beside the belt. The items will arrive with greater spacing (lower frequency) because more of the conveyor belt is passing as the items are placed on the belt.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The red and blue shifting of objects as they travel towards or away from an observer are referred to as the doppler effect. This effect can also be observed when we look at the microwaves in space all around us. These microwaves are referred to as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The big bang theory suggests that at the start everything would have been in a hot condensed state as a plasma. This plasma would have given off very high energy, high frequency electromagnetic radiation. As the universe expanded these electromagnetic waves began to stretch and lose energy due to the distance that they have traveled. As a result of this decrease in energy and frequency space also became colder as time went on. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The farther the electromagnetic waves have to travel the less energy they have, the less heat they have and the less frequency they have. It makes sense that the electromagnetic waves that are around us today are microwaves. We can again use the conveyor belt example to visualize this. This time though, we will also account for the expansion of the universe. For this example the person beside the conveyor belt walks backwards and places the items on the belt like before, but now, the person receiving the items is also walking backwards. And for the analogy to be truly accurate we have to imagine that the conveyor belt is also expanding between the items as they travel to the receiver. This creates even bigger spaces between the items on the conveyor belt and the items are received with lower frequency because as the two workers get farther apart the items also have more time to separate on the conveyor belt as the belt expands. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The electromagnetic waves that are reaching us right now in the form of microwaves have been traveling for billions of years to catch up to us. These electromagnetic waves have been stretched and have experienced a loss of energy which results in a lower frequency. Over time these wavelengths will travel far enough that they’re frequency will drop to the radio wave range of the electromagnetic spectrum. It will then become a Cosmic Radio-Wave Background instead of a Cosmic Microwave Background. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The plasma that created the CMB is also theoretically responsible for all other matter in the universe. As the plasma expanded and diluted its energy over a greater distance electrons, protons and neutrons were able to form atoms and these atoms are the foundation of the different elements and all matter in existence. This matter has been forming stars and planets for billions of years now. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The elements that are thought to have formed first after the big bang are hydrogen and helium. These elements are what initial stars were made up of and over time heavier elements were created through fusion reactions created by exploding stars. A combination of these light and heavy elements are what make up planets and other matter in the universe today, including the earth and our solar system. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Our Solar System
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Our solar system is among many billions of others in our galaxy alone. Each one is suspected to form in a similar way. Scientists have hypothesised that solar systems form from giant clouds of gas and “dust” and have observed evidence of this behaviour in other solar systems. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Within the initial cloud, the star is the first thing to form. Over time gas and other matter in the cloud move closer together due to the gravity that is created by clumps of matter in the cloud. The gas and dust eventually create one or more noticeably bigger spheres of gas and dust. As a sphere gets bigger its core gets hotter because it is constantly being compressed by gravity as the sphere grows. Once big enough and hot enough this dense core will start to create fusion reactions with hydrogen and helium which produces massive amounts of energy. At first this energy is contained by the gravity of the sphere but as the sphere continues to grow it reaches a point where the pressure of the energy produced by the fusion reactions builds up enough to overpower gravity. It is at this point that the star is born and electromagnetic radiation is emitted in all directions.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The remaining matter and gas that was not yet pulled in by the spheres gravity is what forms the planets. Planets are formed in the same way as stars, the only difference is that they don't have as much mass and as a result their cores don’t get hot enough to create the fusion reactions needed to form a star. Jupiter, the biggest planet in our solar system, has about 100 times less mass than the smallest stars that we know of. Our star is a little over 1000 times more massive than Jupiter and about 333,000 times more massive than the earth.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The earth, unlike Jupiter, is mostly solid materials such as metals and rocky matter. Just like a star’s core, earth’s core is constantly being compressed by the planets gravity. The inner core is under so much pressure that the atoms within it can’t move freely. This creates a solid metal ball that is as hot as the surface of the sun ( around 6000 degrees celsius). The outer core has less pressure exerted on it and this means the atoms are able to move freely as liquid metal. Within this outer core, which is close to the size of mars in diameter, the liquid metal is continuously moving and swirling around due to convection currents and the coriolis force. This constant flow of liquid iron generates electric currents and these currents, like all electric currents, create a magnetic field. This magnetic field is responsible for shielding the earth from the sun's radiation.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Evidence of this shielding effect, or lack of, can be seen in the Northern and Southern Lights. The north and south poles of the earth are the weakest points in the magnetic field. When solar flares are ejected from the sun plasma is shot out in the direction of the flare. Usually this plasma is directed away from the earth by the magnetic field but when there is a large enough solar flare, referred to as a coronal mass ejection, some of the plasma penetrates the magnetic field at its weakest points. It is this plasma, reacting with the nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere, that creates the Northern and Southern Lights. The protons and electrons that make up the plasma collide with molecules of nitrogen and oxygen which causes the nitrogen and oxygen to absorb energy. This energy is then released by the molecules in the atmosphere in the form of electromagnetic radiation with varying frequencies including frequencies in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

                    <br></br>
                    This light can kind of serve as a reminder of what's keeping us alive. Nitrogen and oxygen in the air plays a huge role in sustaining life on earth. Oxygen is needed for obvious reasons but nitrogen isn’t usually thought of as important to many people. Some people don’t even know that it is part of the atmosphere at all even though it makes up 78% of the air we breath. Without nitrogen there would be no life. Nitrogen is used by plants and animals to make proteins that are essential for cell production. Without cell production there would be no life. Plants use the nitrates in the soil to grow and survive and we consume these nitrates by eating plants or by eating animals that eat the plants.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The atmosphere that keeps us alive remains bound to the space around a planet because of gravity and the distance the planet is from our star. Gravity needs to be strong enough to hold the atmosphere in place and therefore the planet needs to be large enough to create a sufficient amount of gravity. The proximity to the sun also plays a role because the hotter the molecules in the atmosphere get, the faster they travel. Molecules traveling at very high speeds are harder for gravity to contain and they will fly away from the planet like the plasma from a solar flare. Planets like Mercury are too small and too close to the sun to hold an atmosphere. Earth is much bigger than Mercury and it is also far enough from the sun to keep the gas molecules from flying away from the planet.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The effects of gravity are the strongest near the surface of the planet because the strength of gravity between any two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between these two objects; as the distance between the center of two objects decreases, gravity increases. As a result, the molecules of gas are compressed more near the surface of earth and therefore they are at a higher pressure than the gas that is at a higher altitude. This is why it gets harder to breathe at higher altitudes. The atmosphere is less dense the further from the center of earth you are which means it contains fewer molecules of oxygen in a given area.

                    Gravity is one of the most bizarre phenomena in the universe. Without gravity there would be no clouds of gas condensing to form stars, there would be no galaxies, no atmosphere, no planets, no solar systems and no life. An explanation of how gravity really works would require an in-depth knowledge of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity as well as the highly complex math behind the theories. For now I will try to give a brief overview of the concepts of the theories and hopefully this will provide a better understanding of gravity.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Einstein wasn't the first one to study gravity's effects. Isaac Newton studied the effects that gravity had on objects but he did not figure out why it was happening. Einstein later outlined his predictions as to why gravity has the effects that it does in his relativity theories. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    According to Einstein’s theories, space and time are not two different things. They are very closely related and one has an effect on the other, together they are known as spacetime. Before I try to explain this, it is important to know that gravity’s effects can’t really be visualized correctly in our minds because what is going on is happening in 4 dimensions and we are only able to perceive three dimensions. The three dimensional examples of what I try to explain might not seem accurate for this reason. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    You can think of the emptiness around our planet and throughout the universe as spacetime. The way that an object creates gravity is by bending this spacetime. The more mass an object has, the more it bends the spacetime around it and the more gravity it creates. In three dimensions the most common visualization of this is to imagine a thin sheet of stretchy rubber with a heavy metal ball in it’s center causing the sheet of rubber to stretch and dip as the ball sinks in the center. This represents how spacetime is bending due to the mass within it. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    The curved line in the image below demonstrates the effects that gravity has on objects close enough to its source. Circle A and its path of motion represents what we actually see when we observe gravity's effects. It looks like circle A travels along a straight path towards the bigger circle, circle B. But what is happening with gravity when smaller objects are attracted to larger ones can be represented more accurately by the path that circle C takes towards circle B. In this scenario circle B is actually bending spacetime in a way that causes circle C to accelerate towards it as if it were traveling down a slope, traveling faster as it gets further down the slope just like how gravity gets stronger the closer an object gets to the center of the gravity source.
                    <br></br>

                    <br></br>
                    It is hard to visualize because all that we can see with our eyes is the behaviour that circle A demonstrates as it moves towards circle B. It gets even harder to visualize when we consider that these curves in spacetime are happening at every possible angle all at once. The below image makes this a little easier to visualize but it is still not accurate.
                    <br></br>

                    <br></br>
                    If we shift our attention back to the big ball on the sheet of rubber, we can start to visualize why some smaller objects orbit bigger objects. If you roll a smaller ball on the rubber in a circle around the bigger ball it will orbit the bigger ball on the rubber falling lower and lower as it orbits until eventually it stops when it hits the bottom. This happens because the smaller ball is losing momentum as it battles against earth's gravity which is pulling it as close as possible to the center of the earth. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>

                    <div className = "img-cont">

                    <br></br>
                    The difference between the rubber sheet and space is that objects in orbit in space don’t fall into the object that attracts them, they just orbit them. This is happening because the conditions on earth are very different than the conditions in space. Objects in space never slow down unless an external force acts upon them. So while they are still pulled into bigger objects by gravity they have enough momentum in a direction that acts against gravity to orbit instead of being pulled in. To visualize how the earth is actually orbiting the sun, or how the moon orbits the earth, we can think of another common visualization as an example:
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>

                    <br></br>
                    You can see in this picture, which represents Newton’s cannonball thought experiment, that cannonballs could be fired from a cannon and they will travel a certain distance depending on how much velocity they have. The more velocity, the further they travel before being brought back down to earth's surface by gravity. At a certain point though the cannonball can go fast enough that it will travel around the whole earth, still being pulled in by gravity, but at the same time traveling fast enough to not fall back down towards the ground. This equilibrium will continue on forever unless an outside force affects the velocity of the cannonball or the distance that this cannonball is from earth. We can also see in the picture what would happen when a cannonball travels faster than what is necessary to keep it in orbit. In this scenario the cannonball has enough momentum to overcome gravity completely and continue on through space.

                    Large objects influence the area around them and pull things into them because they are bending spacetime. The lesser known fact is that this gravity also has an impact on the time that elapses in its presence. The more mass an object has, the slower time will run as you get closer to that objects center of gravity. Even on earth’s surface we experience time at a slower rate than we would on the moon’s surface, or on top of a tall building, or even a short one. Any incremental difference in the distance to the center of gravity, the center of the earth, will have an affect on time. These differences are so small that we don't notice them unless we are testing for them though. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    An example of devices that do take these time differences into account are gps satellites. In order to get the correct output to the user a gps system needs to pre-correct for the time differences between the time on earth’s surface and the time at the location of the satellite in orbit. Gravity is stronger at the surface of earth and therefore time runs faster for the satellite.

                    By looking at the above image we can see two lines crossing over an area that is affected by gravity. The green line in the image spans from point A to point B without being affected by the bending of spacetime that the orange circle creates. The red line also spans between these two points however the bending of spacetime does have an affect on it’s path. Since the green line is not affected by the curved space around the orange circle, time for the green line will move at a constant pace. For the red line, since it follows a curved path of space and therefore a curved path of time, more time will elapse for something traveling along the red line. Something that remains in the curved space, like we do on earth, will continuously experience time at a slower rate than would be experienced if there was no gravity affecting us.

                    <br></br>
                    Time is also affected by the speed that an object is traveling at. The faster the object travels through space, the slower time will run for that object. As an object approaches the speed of light it’s time will appear to stop all together. The image below represents an object moving through space at 75,000 km/s, about 25% of light speed.

An object that is theoretically at rest, will only be traveling through time and not at all through space. The line on the chart that would represent this would be vertical along the Y-axis. An object traveling at the speed of light will not be affected by time and will only be moving through space, just like light. The line on the chart that would represent this would be horizontal along the X-axis. The faster an object travels through space, the closer the line will move towards the X-axis and the slower it will move through time.

                    It would seem that at a speed faster than the speed of light, time does not exist. Without time it’s hard to imagine that anything exists at a speed faster than light. It is interesting to imagine though, that an alternative to time not existing beyond the speed of light could instead be interpreted as time reversing as you travel faster than light. Unfortunately traveling faster than the speed of light, as far as we know, is impossible, just like traveling at a speed slower than not moving is impossible. Light has no mass and therefore requires no energy to move through space. It is not possible for an object with mass to travel faster than a massless object because the object that has mass will always be traveling slower than it would be if it did not have any mass.

                    <br></br>
                    Light, or any other electromagnetic radiation, is one of only two things known to be massless (the other is the gluon). The fact that light has no mass, and as a result is able to travel at the speed that it does, 1.08 billion km/h, should mean that light does not experience time at all, as stated above. This makes sense considering that photons travel at a constant speed regardless of how fast the observer is traveling in comparison. For example, if you were a passenger in a bus traveling at 60 km/h and threw something ahead of you at 40 km/h the object that you threw would not only be traveling at 40 km/h, it’s speed would now be 110 km/h, relative to the ground, because of the speed that the bus was already going when your threw it. But light is different. Light travels at a constant speed no matter what the speed of its source is. While the same bus drives down the road at night the light from it’s headlights is always traveling at the exact same speed,1.08 billion km/h, independent of the speed of the bus or whether the bus is traveling forward or backwards. If light followed the same path through time as everything else it wouldn’t be able to maintain this constant speed.

                    When we consider the fact that the speed of light is always constant we can start to understand why things like time dilation occur and why objects get shorter and more massive as they move faster through space.

                    Normally the above formula could be manipulated quite easily because an increase or decrease in either time or distance would either increase or decrease the speed of the object being observed. But when the speed is always constant, like light’s speed, it is now only the distance and time that can be manipulated in the formula.

                    A sense of scale
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I have mentioned some large numbers above and I think it is necessary to provide more information about how big some of these numbers really are. To help explain this I will first provide an analogy that may help make the scale of these numbers more relatable.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I will use time as the example in this analogy because it is something that everybody can relate to. Most commonly, time is referenced in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. One hour is made up of 3,600 seconds which means that one day is 36,400 seconds and 12 days is just over a million seconds. Where it gets interesting though, and where one can really get a sense of scale for these large numbers, is the jump from 1 million to one billion. 1 billion seconds is the equivalent of 30 years. 1 trillion seconds, which is one million seconds times a million, is 31,688 years. Keep this in mind as you continue reading.

                    One of the most baffling facts of the physics of the universe is the speed at which light travels. 1.08 billion kilometers an hour. The Parker Solar Probe, a spacecraft that will become the fastest man made spacecraft in history will use the sun's gravity to reach a speed of 692,000 km/h. This may seem fast but in reality it is only .064% of the speed of light. At this speed it would take 1,567 years to travel even 1 light year in space and over 6,800 years to travel to the closest known solar system to ours, Alpha Centauri, which is 4.34 light years away.

                    One light year is equal to a distance of 9,500,000,000,000 or 9.5 trillion kilometers. The milky way is a medium sized galaxy that spans close to 200,000 light years across (1,900,000,000,000,000,000 or 1.9 quintillion kilometers). In the Milky Way alone there are at least 100 billion other stars, while some say there could be as many as 400 billion. Though, compared to the size of some of the larger galaxies, such as IC 1101, our galaxy is very small. IC 1101 is the largest known galaxy and is an estimated 4 million light years across. It is the home of approximately 100 trillion stars. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    To even cross the span of our much smaller galaxy it would take 200,000 years traveling at the speed of light, which is impossible. Reaching one of the closest galaxies to us, the Andromeda galaxy, 2.5 million light years away, is still far beyond the scope of what is possible in the foreseeable future.

                    <br></br>
                    When we try to think of the magnitude of something like IC 1101 It is impossible to quantify 100 trillion stars and 4 million light years of space in our imaginations. Referring back to the time analogy, we can compare 4 million light years to around 46 days if the light years were seconds. When we define the scope of the observable universe in this analogy in the same way, the result is 1,064,815 days. The Milky Way is 2.3 days of this. The observable universe is 92 billion light years in diameter. It is called the observable universe because beyond this observable portion of the universe even light can not travel fast enough to catch up to us due to the rate that the universe is expanding. There is no telling how much bigger the universe is beyond this point but from what can be seen we are in the company of around 200 billion other galaxies.

                    To people that have ever wondered if there is other life out there maybe the facts above can serve as a little bit of a hint. In my opinion it is highly unlikely that we are alone in such an incomprehensibly vast universe. Though, all facts considered, it is also highly unlikely that the human race will encounter any other life in the near future, if ever. This is because of the amount of time and speed needed to travel anywhere significant and because of the fact that any other life out there will be equally limited by the laws of physics that we are familiar with.

                    A benefit of light speed is that we can use it to quickly communicate with each other. Radio waves are responsible for the signals that we use for our cellphones and the internet. These signals, like all electromagnetic radiation, travel at the speed of light. So although encounters with other life might not seem promising, general communication might be something that is obtainable in some capacity. Of course this is dependant on whether or not life on other planets would be advanced enough to communicate in this way.

                    The dinosaurs lived on earth for 165 million years. Attempts of communication with any planets in a similar phase of it’s evolution, or earlier, would obviously not be able to generate any responses and the situation could potentially remain this way for hundreds of millions of years. Conversely, humans have been around for about 200,000 years; a much smaller window. We didn’t even have light bulbs until 140 years ago. Imagine if our attempts of communication were intercepted by life that has been innovating technology for 165 million years, or even 200,000 years.

                    It’s exciting to think about how much more humans have to grow as a species, assuming we don’t destroy each other or our planet in the process.
