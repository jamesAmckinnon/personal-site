                    Some people are more than happy to spend a big portion of time at their jobs because they enjoy what they do and are fulfilled in life because of the time they spend doing these things but this is rare. Most people live for the weekend and a few hours at the end of the day during the week. 35% of the total hours that people are awake are spent either at work or commuting for work. This is assuming 30 minutes of commute time each day, 8 hours of sleep and 10 vacation days throughout the year. It does not include the time that it takes to get ready for work or any work that takes place beyond an 8 hour work day.

                    What is not realized by simply stating that 35% of people's time is spent at work is that of this 35%, 100% of it is when the body and mind are performing at their best. Peak energy levels for most people are between 8am and 8pm. This means that around 45% of the total time that people are at their best before they retire is spent at work. After retirement, the idea of performing at your best starts to become less attainable during any part of the day as old age sets in.

                    Another commonly unrealized circumstance of people's time allocation throughout the week is that the only time people have to do other unwanted but necessary stuff in life is during the time that is supposed to be "free time" after work. Anything from mowing the lawn to making dinner has to be included which reduces the amount of actual free time even further. Include kids in this equation and free time becomes almost non-existent. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Most people have very little free time and by the time they actually get to this free time they are already exhausted from the day. Weather that is emotional or physical exhaustion it still makes people less willing to focus on much of anything. At this point in the day people just want to relax which really just means to get away from all of the unfulfilling activities that have made up the majority of their day.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Most people get two or three weeks in a year where they get to do whatever they want for their vacation time. For the rest of the year, Saturday is the only day in most people's adult lives where they get to do whatever they want with no constraints on their time. For 8 hours a day 5 days a week most people spend 8 hours wishing the day would be over sooner. The idea of wanting any amount of time to go by faster seems crazy to me, let alone 8 hours almost every single day.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Why do people spend such a large portion of their time doing activities that they don’t enjoy for the majority of their life just to be given their “freedom” at the age of 55 or 60, as their health starts to deteriorate. Retirement as we know it is a farewell from society once it has used up all of the best years of a person's life and is ready for them to be replaced by the next generation.

                    What we are experiencing right now, life, could be the only thing that we ever experience. No one really knows for sure, it is impossible to know for sure. Though people are told that they have to go work for someone, doing something that they have no real desire to do, just to have a place to sleep that isn’t outside on the sidewalk or to have food to eat that’s not from a homeless shelter or to have a sense of community with their peers based on the fact that these people are also spending 35% of their time doing things they don’t enjoy?

                    It is not hard to imagine that when we die we are going to be gone forever. We live at one point in time and then we die at another point in time. This is inevitable. The only time that we have where we are able to choose what we experience, that we know of, is between these two points in time. What most people don’t seem to realize is that relative to how long we’re going to be dead, we’re going to be alive for about a minute. Why would we spend our time doing things that we have no real interest in?
